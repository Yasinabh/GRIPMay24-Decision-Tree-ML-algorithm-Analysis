TASK - Prediction using Decision Tree Algorithm

PROBLEM STATEMENT : Employing a decision tree algorithm, construct a model to classify iris flowers into their respective species based on their sepal and petal measurements. The model will discern patterns in the data to make accurate predictions, aiming for both high accuracy and robust performance on new, unseen data.

ABOUT DATASET: The Iris dataset is a classic benchmark dataset widely used in machine learning and statistical analysis. It consists of measurements from 150 iris flowers, encompassing four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. These measurements are recorded for three distinct species of iris plants: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. Each iris flower in the dataset is labeled with its corresponding species, making it a supervised learning problem. The dataset is well-structured and widely used for training and evaluating various machine learning algorithms, including decision trees, support vector machines, and neural networks
